# Planning Sheet Pro 

The standard functionality of Odoo's MRP operates in a top-down fashion, planning routes and triggering them. This means that the planning team does not have a full visibility of the requirements for a particular order until it is actually planned.

**Before** 

Users often want to compute the entire requirement before making decisions, rather than letting the MRP step-by-step compute each time a Manufacturing Order, Purchase Order, or picking is confirmed.

**After**
 
This issue is addressed by using a new approach called 'Planning Sheet'. This new function works closely with standard features in Odoo MRP, offering more flexibility in defining needs and simulation capabilities.
